                <p>“Amazing! A must! This casual dining restaurant has something for everyone! I had the mushroom risotto with scallops: the dish was to die for! It was a generous portion, served piping hot, creamy and with large scallops. Our wonderful server, Jess, brought us dinner rolls to eat while we waited for our meal. Don’t say I didn’t warn you, the rolls are doughy warm goodness; save room for dinner! Thanks for a wonderful meal!”</p>

                <p>“Breakfast was delicious.We finished our whole plates and were so impressed with the quality of the food and the short amount of time it took to receive it.  Like a good homestyle country savory breakfast (and Im from the south, thats saying a lot)… Enjoyed the whole experience and definitely recommend this place for a place to eat on the cape.”.</p>
